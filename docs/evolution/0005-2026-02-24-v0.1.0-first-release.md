## Metadata

- Date: 2026-02-24

- Authors: taoyi
- Status: accepted
- Scope: release

## Summary

The first public release (`v0.1.0`) was published successfully with macOS artifact and checksum, establishing the initial external distribution baseline.

## Context and Problem

After bootstrapping workspace code and release automation, the project needed a concrete, downloadable milestone to validate end-to-end release readiness.

## Goals and Non-Goals

Goals:
- Publish first stable SemVer tag and GitHub Release.
- Provide downloadable macOS binary artifact and checksum file.

Non-Goals:
- Multi-platform artifact publication.
- Installer packaging beyond compressed binary archive.

## Decision

Use `v0.1.0` as first public milestone because:
- It communicates early-stage but usable baseline.
- It aligns with SemVer progression for future minor/patch releases.

## Alternatives Considered

1. Publish `v0.0.x` instead
- Pros: emphasizes pre-foundation status
- Cons: weaker milestone signal
- Decision: rejected

2. Delay release until broader feature completion
- Pros: bigger initial release
- Cons: slower feedback loop from real users
- Decision: rejected

## Implementation Details

- Tag: `v0.1.0`
- Release name: `simple-term v0.1.0`
- Assets:
  - `simple-term-v0.1.0-macos-arm64.tar.gz`
  - `SHA256SUMS.txt`

## Impact

Technical impact:
- Validated that versioned release path works end-to-end.

Product/user impact:
- Users can download and verify first official binary.

Operational impact:
- Team now has a tested baseline for future release cadence.

## Verification

- Release workflow run completed successfully: `22335259583`.
- Release published at:
  - https://github.com/ttaatoo/simple-term/releases/tag/v0.1.0

## Risks and Follow-ups

- Risk: single-arch macOS asset may not satisfy all macOS users.
- Follow-up: evaluate adding universal binaries when needed.

## Traceability

- Commits: release triggered from `main` HEAD
- PRs: N/A
- Tags: `v0.1.0`
- Releases: `simple-term v0.1.0`
- Workflow runs: `22335259583` (success)
